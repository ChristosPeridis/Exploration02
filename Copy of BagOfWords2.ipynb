    "#**How to Develop a Deep Learning Bag-of-Words Model for Sentiment Analysis (Text Classification)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original Source:** Jason Brownlee, [How to Develop a Deep Learning Bag-of-Words Model for Sentiment Analysis (Text Classification)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-bag-of-words-model-sentiment-analysis/), Available from [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com), accessed December 13, 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie reviews can be classified as either favorable or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of movie review text is a classification problem often called sentiment analysis. A popular technique for developing sentiment analysis models is to use a bag-of-words model that transforms documents into vectors where each word in the document is assigned a score.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover how you can develop a deep learning predictive model using the bag-of-words representation for movie review sentiment classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to prepare the review text data for modeling with a restricted vocabulary.\n",
    "- How to use the bag-of-words model to prepare train and test data.\n",
    "- How to develop a multilayer Perceptron bag-of-words model and use it to make predictions on new review text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tutorial Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is divided into 4 parts; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Movie Review Dataset\n",
    "2. Data Preparation\n",
    "3. Bag-of-Words Representation\n",
    "4. Sentiment Analysis Models"

    "**Movie Review Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Movie Review Data is a collection of movie reviews retrieved from the imdb.com website in the early 2000s by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. The reviews were collected and made available as part of their research on natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is comprised of 1,000 positive and 1,000 negative movie reviews drawn from an archive of the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup hosted at imdb.com. The authors refer to this dataset as the “polarity dataset”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has been cleaned up somewhat, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset is comprised of only English reviews.\n",
    "- All text has been converted to lowercase.\n",
    "- There is white space around punctuation like periods, commas, and brackets.\n",
    "- Text has been split into one sentence per line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has been used for a few related natural language processing tasks. For classification, the performance of classical models (such as Support Vector Machines) on the data is in the range of high 70% to low 80% (e.g. 78%-82%).\n",
    "\n",
    "More sophisticated data preparation may see results as high as 86% with 10-fold cross validation. This gives us a ballpark of low-to-mid 80s if we were looking to use this dataset in experiments on modern methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the dataset from here:\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie Review Polarity Dataset (review_polarity.tar.gz, 3MB) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/review_polarity.tar.gz \n",
    "\n",
    "After unzipping the file, you will have a directory called “txt_sentoken” with two sub-directories containing the text “neg” and “pos” for negative and positive reviews. Reviews are stored one per file with a naming convention cv000 to cv999 for each neg and pos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s look at loading and preparing the text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will look at 3 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of data into training and test sets.\n",
    "Loading and cleaning the data to remove punctuation and numbers.\n",
    "Defining a vocabulary of preferred words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Split into Train and Test Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are pretending that we are developing a system that can predict the sentiment of a textual movie review as either positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that after the model is developed, we will need to make predictions on new textual reviews. This will require all of the same data preparation to be performed on those new reviews as is performed on the training data for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will ensure that this constraint is built into the evaluation of our models by splitting the training and test datasets prior to any data preparation. This means that any knowledge in the test set that could help us better prepare the data (e.g. the words used) is unavailable during the preparation of data and the training of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, we will use the last 100 positive reviews and the last 100 negative reviews as a test set (100 reviews) and the remaining 1,800 reviews as the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a 90% train, 10% split of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The split can be imposed easily by using the filenames of the reviews where reviews named 000 to 899 are for training data and reviews named 900 onwards are for testing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loading and Cleaning Reviews**\n",
    "The text data is already pretty clean, so not much preparation is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without getting too much into the details, we will prepare the data using the following method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split tokens on white space.\n",
    "- Remove all punctuation from words.\n",
    "- Remove all words that are not purely comprised of alphabetical characters.\n",
    "- Remove all words that are known stop words.\n",
    "- Remove all words that have a length <= 1 character.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can put all of these steps into a function called clean_doc() that takes as an argument the raw text loaded from a file and returns a list of cleaned tokens. We can also define a function load_doc() that loads a document from file ready for use with the clean_doc() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of cleaning the first positive review is listed below."
